## chromeUtil

A chrome extension that provides some productivity gains in chrome via
fancy keybindings and the like.

Currently supports keybindings for:
- Muting / un-muting current tab (Cmd-Shift-M)
- Mute / un-mute all other tabs (Cmd+Shift+L)
- pin / unpin current tab (Cmd+Shift+P)
- Close all other abs (Cmd+Shift+K)

NOTE: keybindings also need to be set manually from the bottom of `chrome://extensions`
page.  
This is, unfortunately, unavoidable since latest versions of chrome.


TODO:
- change the logo
- something that uses the ability to open another tab?
- maybe let the user decide, via a gui, what keybindings should apply where (doesn't
sound too appealing though, since the keybindings are already limited in scope)
